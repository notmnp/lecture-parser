The graph features a vertical line at the origin, indicating that the switch is off until a certain voltage threshold is reached, at which point it turns on and allows current to flow.
*   **2. Switch with an Offset Voltage:** The second model introduces an offset voltage, denoted by a green line on a similar graph. This model accounts for the voltage required for the diode to conduct, providing a more realistic representation of diode behavior.
*   **3. Switch with Offset Voltage and Resistance:** The third model incorporates both an offset voltage and resistance, illustrated by a red line on a graph. This model further refines the diode's behavior by considering the internal resistance of the diode when it is conducting.
*   **4. Include Reverse Breakdown:** The fourth and final model includes reverse breakdown, represented by an orange line on a graph. This model acknowledges that diodes can break down and conduct current in the reverse direction if the voltage across them exceeds a certain threshold.

Each model is accompanied by a corresponding circuit diagram, which helps to visualize the implementation of these diode models in electronic circuits. The image provides a clear and concise comparison of the different diode models, allowing viewers to understand their characteristics and applications.

In summary, the image effectively communicates the various diode models, ranging from the simple switch to more complex models that account for offset voltage, resistance, and reverse breakdown.

### Slide 32

## Step 1: Analyze the first scenario
The first scenario involves a system that occasionally powers a cooling fan using a 5 V DC motor with a maximum current of 2 A. For this scenario, we need a MOSFET that can handle at least 2 A of current.

## Step 2: Evaluate MOSFET options for the first scenario
- Option A (2N7000): $I_{DS,cont} = 110$ mA, which is less than 2 A.
- Option B (IRF610): $I_{DS,cont} = 3.3$ A, which is more than 2 A.
- Option C (IQDH29): $I_{DS,cont} = 789$ A, which is more than 2 A.

## 3: Analyze the second scenario
The second scenario is for a high-current eBike fast charger. This requires a MOSFET that can handle high current.

## 4: Evaluate MOSFET options for the second scenario
- Option A (2N7000): $I_{DS,cont} = 110$ mA, which is not suitable for high-current applications.
- Option B (IRF610): $I_{DS,cont} = 3.3$ A, still relatively low for a fast charger.
- Option C (IQDH29): $I_{DS,cont} = 789$ A, which is suitable for high-current applications.

## 5: Analyze the third scenario
The third scenario requires toggling a transistor ON and OFF as fast as possible. This implies a need for low capacitance for fast switching.

## 6: Evaluate MOSFET options for the third scenario
- Option A (2N7000): $C_{GS} = 20$ pF.
- Option B (IRF610): $C_{GS} = 140$ pF.
- Option C (IQDH29): $C_{GS} = 13$ nF $= 13,000$ pF, which is very high.

## 7: Summarize findings for each scenario
1. For the cooling fan (2 A, 5 V): Options B or C could work, but B is cheaper and sufficient.
2. For the eBike fast charger (high current): Option C is the best.
3. For fast toggling: Option A seems the best due to its low $C_{GS}$.

## 8: Conclusion
- Scenario 1: Option B (IRF610) seems suitable due to its current rating and cost.
- Scenario 2: Option C (IQDH29) is the most suitable due to its high current rating.
- Scenario 3: Option A (2N7000) seems best for fast switching due to lower $C_{GS}$. 

The best answer is not provided as this problem requires analysis rather than selecting a single numerical answer. However, based on the scenarios:
- For scenario 1, choose B.
- For scenario 2, choose C.
- For scenario 3, choose A.

**Equations Section:**

*   The right side of the slide presents several equations related to small signal modeling:
    *   The definition of a "small signal": In saturation, $i_D = \frac{1}{2}k_nv_{ov}^2$, where $v_{ov} = V_{GS} - V_t$.
    *   The equation for $i_D$ is expanded and grouped into three terms:
        *   $\frac{1}{2}k_n(V_{GS}-V_t)^2 \leftarrow I_D$
        *   $k_n(V_{GS}-V_t)v_{gs} \leftarrow g_mv_{gs}$
        *   $\frac{1}{2}k_nv_{gs}^2 \leftarrow$ Nonlinear
    *   The condition for a small signal is that $v_{gs}$ should be small so that nonlinearity is negligible.

**Small Signal Model Section:**

*   The bottom-right corner of the slide shows the small signal model of a MOSFET:
    *   The model consists of a current source $i_d = g_mv_{gs}$ in parallel with the gate-source capacitance (not shown).
    *   The model is a simplified representation of the MOSFET's behavior for small signal analysis.

In summary, the slide provides a comprehensive overview of the small signal model for MOSFET amplifiers, including the graphical representation of the MOSFET's current-voltage characteristics, the flowchart for analyzing circuits using the small signal model, and the relevant equations for small signal analysis.

**Hybrid π Model**

*   The model is represented by a circuit diagram with the following components:
    *   A voltage source $v_{gs}$ connected to a dependent current source $g_m v_{gs}$, which is then connected to a resistor $r_o$ and the drain terminal $D$.
    *   The source terminal $S$ is connected to the gate terminal $G$ through a wire.
*   Equations and definitions:
    *   $r_o \equiv$ small signal output resistance
    *   $= V_A / I_D$
    *   $V_A \equiv$ "Early Voltage"
    *   $\lambda \equiv$ Channel Length Modulation Factor
*   Handwritten notes:
    *   Current due to $v_{gs}$ and $v_{ds}$

**I-V Characteristics Graph**

*   A graph showing the I-V characteristics of a MOSFET, with:
    *   $v_{DS}$ on the x-axis and $i_D$ on the y-axis
    *   Multiple curves representing different gate-source voltages $V_{GS}$
    *   A vertical line labeled "Triode" and a horizontal line labeled "Saturation"
    *   A dashed green line with a slope of $1/r_o$

**T-Model**

*   Two circuit diagrams representing the T-model:
    *   The left diagram shows a dependent current source $g_m v_{gs}$ connected to a resistor $1/g_m$ and $r_o$, with the gate terminal $G$ connected to the source terminal $S$.
    *   The right diagram shows a dependent current source $i$ connected to a resistor $1/g_m$ and $r_o$, with the gate terminal $G$ connected to the source terminal $S$.

**Equations and Notes**

*   Accounts for CLM (Channel Length Modulation):
    *   $i_D = \frac{1}{2} K_n v_{ov}^2 (1 + \lambda v_{ds})$
*   Note: Affects $I_D$, but we often ignore in DC analysis

In summary, the image provides a detailed comparison of the Hybrid π Model and the T-model for small signal analysis, including their circuit diagrams, equations, and definitions. The I-V characteristics graph illustrates the behavior of a MOSFET in different regions of operation.

### Slide 57

The slide presents a comprehensive overview of amplifier nomenclature, focusing on the various gains and their definitions in the context of amplifier circuits. The title "Amplifier Nomenclature" is prominently displayed at the top.

**Table: Amplifier Gains and Considerations**

A table on the left side of the slide outlines four types of amplifier gains, considering the load resistance \(R_L\) and signal resistance \(R_{sig}\):

| Considers: | \(R_L\) | \(R_{sig}\) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \(A_{v0}\) | \(\times\) | \(\times\) |
| \(A_v\) | \(\checkmark\) | \(\times\) |
| \(G_{v0}\) | \(\times\) | \(\checkmark\) |
| \(G_v\) | \(\checkmark\) | \(\checkmark\) |

- \(A_{v0}\): Open-circuit voltage gain
- \(A_v\): Voltage gain
- \(G_{v0}\): Overall open-circuit voltage gain
- \(G_v\): Overall voltage gain

**Circuit Diagram and Gain Definitions**

On the right side of the slide, a circuit diagram illustrates an amplifier with input and output sections. The diagram includes:
- \(R_{sig}\): Signal resistance
- \(R_{in}\): Input resistance
- \(R_L\): Load resistance
- \(v_i\): Input voltage
- \(v_o\): Output voltage
- \(i_i\): Input current
- \(i_o\): Output current

Handwritten notes around the diagram define the gains:
- \(A_{v0}\) is labeled as "Open-circuit voltage gain."
- \(A_v\) is noted as "Voltage Gain \(\frac{v_o}{v_i}\)."
- \(G_{v0}\) is defined as "Overall open-circuit voltage gain."
- \(G_v\) is identified as "Overall voltage gain."

**Gain Formulae and Relationships**

The slide implies relationships between these gains but does not explicitly write out their formulae. However, based on standard amplifier theory, we can infer:
- \(A_{v0} = \frac{v_o}{v_i}\) when \(R_L = \infty\) and \(R_{sig} = 0\)
- \(A_v = \frac{v_o}{v_i}\) considering \(R_L\) but not \(R_{sig}\)
- \(G_{v0} = \frac{v_o}{v_{sig}}\) when \(R_L = \infty\)
- \(G_v = \frac{v_o}{v_{sig}}\) considering both \(R_L\) and \(R_{sig}\)

**Graphical Representation of Gains**

The slide includes hand-drawn curves representing \(A_v\), \(A_{v0}\), \(G_v\), and \(G_{v0}\), illustrating how these gains relate to each other graphically, though specific values or scales are not provided.

In summary, the slide provides a detailed look into the nomenclature of amplifier gains, including open-circuit voltage gain, voltage gain, overall open-circuit voltage gain, and overall voltage gain, and how they are considered with respect to load and signal resistances.

### Problem Statement

The problem statement reads:

The NMOS transistor in the circuit in Fig. 7.1.1 has $\mu_nC_{ox}=0.4mA/V^2$, $W/L=25$, and $V_t=0.4V$.

(a) Find the value of $V_{GS}$ that results in saturation-mode operation with a dc current of $0.1mA$. Neglect the Early effect.

(b) Find the value of $R_D$ that results in a dc drain voltage of $0.5V$.

(c) Find $g_m$ and $r_o$ at the dc operating point specified above. Assume $V_A=5V$.

(d) Find the open-circuit voltage gain $A_{vo}$.

(e) If a sinusoidal signal with peak amplitude $V_i$ is superimposed on the dc voltage $V_{GS}$, find the maximum allowable value of $V_i$ for which the transistor operates in saturation.

### Handwritten Notes

The handwritten notes on the right side of the slide provide solutions to the problem:

#### Part (a)

* $I_D=0.1mA$
* $I_D=\frac{1}{2}\mu_nC_{ox}\frac{W}{L}V_{ov}^2$
* $V_{ov}^2=\frac{2\cdot0.1}{0.4\cdot25}=0.02$
* $V_{ov}=\sqrt{0.02}=0.141V$
* $V_t=0.4V$, so $V_{GS}=V_t+V_{ov}=0.4+0.141=0.541V$

#### Part (b)

* $R_D=\frac{1.5-0.5}{0.1}=10k\Omega$

#### Part (c)

* $g_m=\frac{2I_D}{V_{ov}}=\frac{2\cdot0.1}{0.141}=1.42mA/V$
